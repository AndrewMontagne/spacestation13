# Change suggestions #

  * Currently there's a couple of pre-generated stacks of 50 metal at engineering which you can pick up, but if you pick up metal from anywhere else you can only carry 5 at a time.
    * Maybe change both to 20 or something?
  * Increase welder fuel capacity a little. Currently you need to refuel after three uses on walls.
  * Add a message to when you're pretty much doing anything, to get a confirmation that you're doing that thing. Because of lag and lost mouseclicks, sometimes it would be nice-to-know. At least these should have some sort of a message:
    * When you try to get up or when you lie down from the UI buttons.
    * When you go to sleep or try to wake up.
    * When you add cabling.
