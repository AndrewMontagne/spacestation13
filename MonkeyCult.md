**Cult Leaders**

Up to three players will start as Cult Leaders, with the usual traitor item purchasing ability. They also begin with a banana peel.

Cult Leaders are marked with a red C to other cultists.

Starting Text**: You are a cult leader! You have infiltrated yourself onto Space Station 13, where the prophecy says you will summon the Elder God Monkeythulhu to cleanse the universe.**

To do so, you and the other Cult Leaders must sacrifice a list of 10 items to draw the interest of Monkeythulhu to this realm, and any three crewmembers to open the portal.

To sacrifice something, place it upon the altar in the chapel and say "Monkeythulhu fhtagn", and if the item is worthy, it will be sacrificed.

Do not dally, as the closer to Monkeythulhu's awakening you are, the more the universe will tear.

These are the items you must sacrifice : (list)

**Cultists**

Players who slip on a banana peel become a cultist and are given their mission.

Cultists can be un-cultified by being hit in the head.

Cultists are marked with a blue C to other cultists.

**The Summoning Ritual**

The ritual for summoning Monkeythulhu requires the sacrifice of 10 items on the station, along with three crew members.

The crew members sacrificed aren't specific, but the items are chosen from a list of items usually found in the possession of some people.

Items and crew sacrifices must be done at the Altar. The item to be sacrificed is placed upon the altar, and the Cult Leader must chant a line for the sacrifice to be accepted.

As each item is sacrificed, a small explosion will occur in a random area of the station.

When 5 items are sacrificed, every minute an area will hear random mutterings or sounds.

When 9 items are sacrificed, time-space anomolies will appear everywhere.

Then 10 items and the three crew members are sacrificed, Monkeythulhu will spawn at the Escape Hallway, then a losing animation will play before the server is restarted.
