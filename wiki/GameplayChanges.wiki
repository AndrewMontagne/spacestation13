#summary General gameplay mechanic change suggestions.

= Change suggestions =

 * Currently there's a couple of pre-generated stacks of 50 metal at engineering which you can pick up, but if you pick up metal from anywhere else you can only carry 5 at a time.
  * Maybe change both to 20 or something?
 * Increase welder fuel capacity a little. Currently you need to refuel after three uses on walls.
 * Add a message to when you're pretty much doing anything, to get a confirmation that you're doing that thing. Because of lag and lost mouseclicks, sometimes it would be nice-to-know. At least these should have some sort of a message:
  * When you try to get up or when you lie down from the UI buttons.
  * When you go to sleep or try to wake up.
  * When you add cabling.
