= Introduction =

While sharing the same area, Chemists have a lot they can do, while Scientists are usually left alone to make bombs, bombs, and more bombs. These are the plans to combine the two jobs and resulting area into a single job heading.

What I'm hoping to create is a system where researchers can analyze objects and creatures, extract things from them, and create new things.

*Area Changes*
  * The Toxins area will be rebuilt and renamed to Research Lab. Current plans are to enlarge it even more, and have it set up as separate rooms which can be sealed off, so that an accident in one room does not break everything.
  * The lab will be split into areas :
    * *Research Labs*
      * Chemistry Lab
      * Materials Lab
      * Thermal Lab
      * (Unknown lab type)
    * *Storage*
      * Gas Storage
      * Monkey Storage
