#summary Plans for a new game mode centered around possessing spirits.

= Introduction =

The basic premise is that you are a powerful spirit bound to an idol. You have a great blood thirst and must sate it.

Your idol has found its way to SS13.


= Details =

*Starting*

The Spirit starts the round as a normal crew member, though noted that he 'took over the body' on the transport. He will then be able to choose the form of his idol before he begins his mission of death.

*Idol Forms*
The idol is meant to be something common and picked up regularly. This is how the spirit possesses people.
  * Tazer Gun
  * Crowbar
  * Stun Baton
  * ElectroMagnet Card
  * Welder

*Possessing*

If the Spirit drops his idol while in his 'original' body, it will instantly die and he will be turned into a red ghost that only other ghosts can see.

When someone picks up the idol and holds it for 30 seconds, they can then become possessed by the Spirit.

When possessed, the victim will lose all control and voice, but will still be able to see and hear everything around their character. The functions say, ooc, and emote will be disabled. 

If the victim ever loses possession of the idol, he instantly regains control but becomes unconscious (short duration, maybe 20 seconds) to disorient him.

*Idol Destruction*

The Crew wins if the idol is destroyed or if they escape on the shuttle before the Spirit kills his quota. Only two things can destroy it : Intense Fire and a Black Hole. 

*Idol Recovery*

The Possessed is able to 'return' the idol to a few parts of the station with his "Recovery" power. He is then able to choose one of these locations to 'teleport' the idol to : 
  * Bridge
  * Cafeteria
  * Bar
  * Hydroponics
  * Research (currently Toxins)
  * Assistant Supply
  * Cargo Bay

This power can only be used once every 5 minutes.
